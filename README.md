# odin-recipes
Hello future Zach, this is the first project that you're working on. Currently, you're working on this at 10:20pm on Wednesday, Jan 3rd, 2024. You're starting to take this seriously, which you should being you're a programmer/analyst daily. 

Currently, at this point of the Odin Project, you're demonstrating skills in HTML primarily. This includes boilerplates for HTML and how to get them to appear. From here, you've learned how to include the basics of the boilerplate, i.e. images/videos within the body. 
The basics are also within this knowledge, such as the h1, h2, etc tags, the p tags, and so on.

You've also learned about the basics of relative and absolute links. Relative links are within your own directory, allowing you to snap to links within your own website. Absolute links allow you to link to other sites around the web. You can enhance the safety of these absolute links as well, using the no(something) and no(something).

Currently, this repo is a blend of all that knowledge to create a recipe site.

You've also been using Mimo for on-the-go coding knowledge for JS atm, atta babe.
